      <p>Neurodiversity matters in STEM because different ways of thinking
        expand the space of possible solutions.</p>
      <p>This topic explores the unique contributions of neurodivergent
        individuals, reframing neurodiversity as a valuable asset rather than a
        deficit. Specific cognitive skills often associated with
        neurodivergence, such as divergent thinking, detail-oriented thinking,
        and strong visual-spatial skills, are highly valuable in STEM fields.

      <p>A strengths-based lens reframes neurodivergence from deficit to asset
        and asks how education and workplaces can surface, support, and apply
        those assets to complex problems.</p>
      <p>Let‚Äôs look now at how researchers and organisations have tried to
        capture this idea, moving from definitions of divergent thinking, to
        practical design commitments, and finally to frameworks for re-imagining
        engineering education.</p>

        <p><strong>Definition.</strong> In this module we use the phrase
          <em>divergent thinking</em> to emphasise how idea generation strengths
          often associated with neurodiversity can enrich STEM. In the research
          literature this ability is studied under the term <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divergent_thinking"
            target="_blank" rel="noopener">divergent thinking</a>, first
          introduced by psychologist <strong>J. P. Guilford</strong> in his 1950
          address to the American Psychological Association. Guilford
          distinguished divergent thinking (producing many, varied, and original
          ideas) from convergent thinking, which narrows to one correct answer.
        </p>
        <p>Later studies, such as the <strong>meta-analysis by Runco and Acar
            (2012)</strong>, showed that performance on divergent-thinking tasks
          is a reasonable indicator of creative potential. In engineering design
          research, <strong>Shah, Vargas-Hernandez, and Smith (2003)</strong>
          formalised how variety, novelty, and originality of ideas can be
          measured to assess ideation effectiveness. Together, this work shows
          that divergent thinking is not just a psychological curiosity but a
          measurable driver of creativity and innovation in STEM.</p>

      </div>
      <p>But what does this mean in practice for STEM education and workplaces?
        The following points show how divergent thinking supports design,
        problem-solving and collaboration.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Expands the design space.</strong> During early concept
          exploration, divergent thinking generates multiple viable pathways
          instead of a single default solution, increasing the chance of
          discovering high-quality designs.</li>
        <li><strong>Enables parallel prototyping.</strong> Producing varied
          approaches early allows teams to build and test small prototypes in
          parallel, exposing constraints and opportunities that might be missed
          with a single-track approach.</li>
        <li><strong>Improves resilience to uncertainty.</strong> In complex or
          poorly specified problems, sustaining several candidate approaches
          reduces the risk that one incorrect assumption collapses the project.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Supports inclusive role allocation.</strong> Multiple
          solution paths allow team members with different cognitive profiles to
          take the lead on the strand that best matches their strengths.</li>
        <li><strong>Feeds better convergent decisions.</strong> Divergent
          thinking precedes convergence: once options are generated, structured
          evaluation and trade-off analysis can select the most robust design.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>Building on this definition of divergent thinking, we can explore how
        organisations and researchers have created frameworks to bring a
        strengths-based lens into STEM. Two examples are presented below: TERC‚Äôs
        applied education design commitments and Frontiers in Education‚Äôs

                  <p>This means moving beyond definitions and committing to new
                    designs. Co-creation with neurodivergent learners, attention
                    to executive function, and flexible, talent-first pathways
                    become practical ways to translate strengths into outcomes.

                  <p><strong>Co-creation.</strong> Learners act as partners in
                    shaping tasks, rubrics and workflows, using participatory
                    design to ensure formats, tools and assessment criteria

                  <p><strong>Executive function supports.</strong> Educators can

                    self-monitoring ‚Äî such as visual schedules, step-by-step

                <p>Frontiers in Education (2022) builds on these ideas
                  conceptually. In their article ‚ÄúReframing neurodiversity in
                  engineering education,‚Äù Chrysochoou, Zaghi and Syharat argue
                  that neurodiverse learners are under-represented because of
                  deficit framings rather than lack of capability. Their
                  strengths-based concept analysis highlights assets including
                  divergent thinking, visual-spatial ability, systems thinking,
                  intuition and pattern recognition.</p>
                <p>But what does this mean for practice? The authors recommend
                  inclusive pedagogy and flexible structures that allow learners
                  to cultivate and apply their strengths. This not only benefits
                  neurodivergent students but enhances creativity and innovation
                  across the entire engineering workforce.</p>
